# ðŸ“‹ Creating Product Requirements Document

I'm using the comprehensive project brief as foundation and will work through each section systematically. The PRD will translate your ConsultingAI concepts into detailed technical requirements with epic/story structure.

## Starting with Goals and Background Context

Since we have your excellent project brief, I'll extract the core goals and background context from it:

### Goals
- Demonstrate sophisticated UserProxyAgent integration through "Chief Engagement Manager" role
- Implement tiered escalation system (Agent-Only â†’ Junior Specialist â†’ Senior Partner)  
- Create dynamic expertise sourcing with human persona switching capabilities
- Showcase multi-team SoM coordination through consulting firm metaphor
- Achieve academic excellence across all evaluation criteria (SoM 25%, UserProxyAgent 35%, Code Quality 25%, Creativity 15%)

### Background Context

ConsultingAI addresses the critical gap in intelligent human-AI collaboration within multi-agent systems. Traditional implementations rely on basic approve/reject patterns that create human bottlenecks and fail to leverage specialized expertise effectively. Our consulting firm metaphor provides a proven organizational model for intelligent decision routing, expertise matching, and institutional memory - delivering both academic innovation and practical applicability.

The system implements Microsoft AutoGen's Society of Mind framework through the lens of a digital advisory firm, where the UserProxyAgent serves as Chief Engagement Manager orchestrating sophisticated human-AI collaboration patterns.

The next section will define the UI/UX approach for your command-line demonstration interface.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

ConsultingAI's user experience centers on creating an intuitive "executive briefing" style interface where humans seamlessly transition between different expert personas while receiving clear, contextual guidance. The interface should feel like interacting with a sophisticated consulting firm's internal coordination system - professional, efficient, and expertise-focused.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

**Expert Role Guidance**: Clear prompts and context switching that help humans understand their current expertise role and the specific type of input needed

**Escalation Transparency**: Users receive clear explanations of why decisions are being escalated, what expertise is required, and how their input will be used

**Institutional Memory**: The system acknowledges previous interactions and learned preferences, creating a sense of continuity and professional relationship

**Executive Summary Style**: Complex technical information is presented in consulting-style executive summaries with clear recommendations and decision points

### Core Screens and Views

**Main Coordination Dashboard**: Central command interface showing active teams, pending escalations, and system status with clear role identification

**Expert Role Interface**: Context-specific interaction screens that adapt based on current human persona (Python Guru vs System Architect vs Business Analyst)

**Escalation Decision View**: Structured presentation of decisions requiring human intervention with background context, agent recommendations, and clear action options

**Team Status Overview**: Real-time view of inner team activities, outer team coordination, and resource allocation across concurrent projects

**Decision History Log**: Professional audit trail showing decision progression, human inputs, and system learning patterns for academic evaluation

**Inter-Team Coordination Panel**: Interface for managing communication and resource allocation between multiple inner teams
