# Project Brief: ConsultingAI - Digital Advisory Firm

## Executive Summary

**Project Concept**: ConsultingAI is a sophisticated multi-agent system implementing Microsoft AutoGen's Society of Mind (SoM) framework, designed around the metaphor of a corporate consulting firm. The system demonstrates advanced UserProxyAgent integration through a "Chief Engagement Manager" that orchestrates human-AI collaboration using consulting industry patterns.

**Primary Problem**: Traditional multi-agent systems lack sophisticated human-in-the-loop mechanisms that intelligently route decisions based on complexity, expertise requirements, and human preferences. Current implementations often overwhelm humans with trivial decisions or fail to escalate critical issues appropriately.

**Target Users**: AI engineering professionals, academic evaluators, and developers studying advanced multi-agent coordination patterns.

**Key Value Proposition**: A novel approach to human-AI collaboration that mimics real-world consulting firm hierarchies, featuring tiered escalation, dynamic expertise sourcing, stakeholder simulation, and institutional memory - all orchestrated through an intelligent UserProxyAgent.

---

## Problem Statement

**Current Challenge**: Academic and industrial multi-agent systems typically implement basic approve/reject human intervention patterns that:
- Create human bottlenecks on trivial decisions
- Fail to leverage specialized human expertise efficiently  
- Lack learning mechanisms to reduce future human workload
- Don't scale effectively across multiple agent teams

**Impact**: Suboptimal human-AI collaboration leading to inefficient workflows, human fatigue, and missed opportunities for intelligent automation.

**Why Existing Solutions Fall Short**: Current UserProxyAgent implementations are reactive rather than proactive, lack sophisticated routing logic, and don't capture or utilize human decision patterns.

**Urgency**: As multi-agent systems become more complex, the need for intelligent human-AI coordination becomes critical for practical deployment.
