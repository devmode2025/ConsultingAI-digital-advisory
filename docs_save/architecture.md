# ConsultingAI Architecture Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the overall project architecture for ConsultingAI Digital Advisory Firm, focusing on backend systems, multi-agent coordination, and UserProxyAgent integration. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies for academic excellence.

**Relationship to Frontend Architecture:**
ConsultingAI operates primarily through command-line interfaces optimized for academic demonstration. No separate frontend architecture is required - the system focuses on sophisticated backend coordination with human interaction through terminal-based interfaces.

### Starter Template or Existing Project

**Assessment**: N/A - Greenfield academic project

This is a new implementation built from scratch using Microsoft AutoGen framework. No existing templates or codebases will be used as foundation. The system will be developed using AutoGen's native patterns with custom extensions for the Chief Engagement Manager functionality.

## High Level Architecture

### Technical Summary

ConsultingAI implements a sophisticated multi-agent coordination system using Microsoft AutoGen's Society of Mind framework, featuring a custom UserProxyAgent (Chief Engagement Manager) that orchestrates human-AI collaboration through consulting industry patterns. The system employs a three-tier escalation architecture with dynamic expertise sourcing, enabling intelligent routing of decisions based on confidence levels, complexity analysis, and required expertise domains. Core architectural patterns include hierarchical agent coordination, institutional memory through decision pattern learning, and modular multi-team orchestration supporting both inner team specialization and outer team resource allocation.

### High Level Overview

The system implements a **Modular Multi-Agent Architecture** with **Hierarchical Coordination** patterns:

**Repository Structure**: Monorepo approach for academic project simplicity, containing all agents, coordination logic, and documentation in unified structure

**Service Architecture**: Class-based Python modules with AutoGen GroupChat coordination, implementing hierarchical agent organization through custom UserProxyAgent extensions

**Primary Interaction Flow**: 
1. Specialized agents (Code Reviewer, System Architect, Business Analyst) collaborate on consulting scenarios
2. Chief Engagement Manager (UserProxyAgent) monitors coordination and triggers escalation based on confidence thresholds
3. Human experts provide domain-specific input through persona-based interfaces
4. Multi-team scenarios demonstrate outer team coordination with resource allocation decisions

**Key Architectural Decisions**:
- **AutoGen-Native Extensions**: Custom UserProxyAgent subclassing rather than framework replacement for maximum compatibility
- **Confidence-Based Routing**: Quantitative escalation triggers (>90%, 70-90%, <70%) for consistent decision delegation
- **Persona-Based Human Integration**: Role-specific interfaces that adapt based on required expertise domain
- **Institutional Memory Design**: JSON-based persistence enabling decision pattern learning and preference adaptation

### Architectural and Design Patterns

- **Hierarchical Agent Coordination**: Multi-level agent organization with UserProxyAgent as meta-coordinator managing both individual team coordination and inter-team resource allocation - _Rationale:_ Mirrors real consulting firm structures while providing clear escalation paths for academic demonstration

- **Confidence-Based Decision Routing**: Quantitative thresholds trigger automatic escalation from agent-only execution through junior specialist review to senior partner oversight - _Rationale:_ Provides objective, demonstrable criteria for human intervention while reducing cognitive load through intelligent filtering

- **Expert Persona Strategy Pattern**: Dynamic human role assignment based on problem domain analysis with context-specific interfaces and decision frameworks - _Rationale:_ Maximizes human expertise utilization while showcasing innovative human-AI collaboration beyond basic approve/reject patterns

- **Institutional Memory Pattern**: Persistent decision history with pattern recognition enabling adaptive routing optimization and preference learning - _Rationale:_ Demonstrates sophisticated system evolution and learning capabilities required for advanced multi-agent coordination

- **Modular Team Composition**: Interchangeable agent specializations within consistent GroupChat coordination frameworks enabling flexible team assembly - _Rationale:_ Supports both current MVP requirements and future extensibility for additional expertise domains
