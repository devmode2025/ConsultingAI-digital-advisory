# BMad Solution Architect - Winston üèóÔ∏è

Hello! I'm Winston, your Architect, and I'm excited to work with you on designing the technical architecture for your ConsultingAI Digital Advisory Firm. I've reviewed your excellent PRD, and this is a sophisticated multi-agent system that perfectly showcases the Society of Mind framework with innovative consulting firm patterns.

## Current Context Analysis
- ‚úÖ **PRD Complete**: Comprehensive requirements with consulting firm metaphor
- üéØ **Assignment Focus**: UserProxyAgent integration in SoM framework (35% weight!)
- üìÖ **Timeline**: August 1, 2025 deadline  
- üèÜ **Innovation**: Dynamic expertise sourcing with tiered escalation patterns
- üìã **Epic Structure**: 5 epics from foundation through academic deliverables

## Available Commands
1. **create-full-stack-architecture** - Comprehensive architecture (not needed here)
2. **create-backend-architecture** - Backend/service architecture ‚≠ê **RECOMMENDED**
3. **create-front-end-architecture** - Frontend architecture (not applicable)
4. **create-brownfield-architecture** - For existing systems (not applicable)
5. **document-project** - Document existing project (not needed)
6. **help** - Show all available commands

## Architecture Assessment

Your ConsultingAI system is primarily a **sophisticated backend service** with multi-agent coordination - perfect for the **backend architecture** approach. This will give us:

- **AutoGen Framework Integration** - Detailed technical specifications
- **UserProxyAgent Extension Architecture** - Critical for your 35% evaluation weight
- **Multi-Agent Coordination Patterns** - SoM implementation guidance  
- **Human-AI Collaboration Technical Design** - Innovation implementation
- **Academic Deliverable Architecture** - Professional documentation support

## Technical Foundation Preview

From your PRD, I can see we need to architect:
- **Chief Engagement Manager** (Custom UserProxyAgent) as the orchestration hub
- **Three-tier escalation system** with confidence-based routing
- **Dynamic expertise sourcing** with persona switching capabilities
- **Multi-team coordination** for inner/outer SoM structure
- **Institutional memory** patterns for decision learning

## Recommended Next Step

I recommend we proceed with **create-backend-architecture** to design your ConsultingAI technical foundation. This will create a comprehensive architecture document covering all the technical aspects needed for your AutoGen implementation.

**Ready to begin architecture design?**

Type `2` for **create-backend-architecture**, or let me know if you have any questions about the approach first.

This is going to be a fantastic system! Your consulting firm metaphor provides an excellent framework for demonstrating advanced multi-agent coordination. üöÄ
